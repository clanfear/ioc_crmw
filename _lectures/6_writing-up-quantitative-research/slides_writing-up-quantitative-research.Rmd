# General Tips

.pull-left[
* **Clarity comes first**

   * *Do not write so you can be understood, but so that so you cannot be misunderstood*

* **Read** good books on writing &rarr;

* **Read** and emulate good writers

* **Read** your work out loud

   * *Good writing seems natural*

* Have others read your work

   * *When someone says something is confusing they are always right*

# Describing Methods

<br>

![:width 80%](img/klm.png)

## What to Include

.pull-left[

From reading:

* Completeness

   + *Describe everything you did*

* Clarity

   + *Describe each thing in sufficient detail for the average reader to understand what was done*

* Credibility

   + *Justify your choices*
   + What you did should follow logically from your **research design**
]

--

.pull-right[
From me:

* Know your audience

   + *Journal of Quantitative Criminology*
   + *Criminology*
   + Policy reports
   + Public scholarship

* Lean on references

   + "Following Sampson et al. (1997), I..."
   
* **Do not neglect justifications**

* **Do not oversell**

]


---

## Three Quantities


.pull-left-60[

* **Estimand**: the real-world quantity we want to measure

   + Your literature review justifies interest in the estimand


* **Estimator**: the procedure we use to calculate the estimate using data

   + Your research design justifies the use of estimator


* **Estimate**: the calculated quantity approximating our estimand

   + The validity of your design justifies trust in this estimate

# Text Examples

Highlighting big hooks:

> Race and ethnic differences in exposure to firearm violence are pronounced, with both forms of exposure highest for Black respondents (Figure 2A). By age 40, an estimated 7.47% of Black and 7.05% of Hispanic respondents had been shot, with one Black and one Hispanic respondent fatally shot. In contrast, an estimated 3.13% of White respondents were victims of a shooting by age 40.<sup>1</sup>

Main estimates:

> 1 standard deviation higher level of abandoned buildings—21 percent more block faces with abandoned buildings on and around that block—is expected to be associated with, on average, approximately 20 percent more homicides and gun assaults than an otherwise similar block.<sup>2</sup>

# Tables

Tables should stand alone

Style

* Few lines
* Few digits
* Order rows and columns logically

---

# Table Tools

Non-Programmatic

* Word / Google Docs
* Excel / Google Sheets

Programmatic

* R Markdown
* $\LaTeX$

# Example

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tribble(~Condition, ~`Walk-By`, ~Mail, ~Theft,
        "Control", 1496, 176, 28,
        "Treatment", 1617, 136, 28
       ) |>
  pivot_longer(`Walk-By`:Theft, names_to = "Outcome", values_to = "Count") |>
  group_by(Condition) |>
  mutate(Prop = Count / sum(Count)) |>
  mutate(Prop = paste0(format(round(Prop*100,1), nsmall =1), "%"),
         Count = as.character(Count)) |>
  pivot_longer(-c(Condition, Outcome)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Outcome, values_from = value) |>
  select(-name) |>

  fontsize(size = 16, part = "all") |>
  add_header_lines("Table 1. Actions by treatment condition") |>
  fix_border_issues(part = "all")
  
```

**Causal** design:

* "There was no **effect** of treatment on theft."
* "The treatment **reduced** mailing by 2.8 percentage points."

* What do we plot

   + *Nearly everything, if possible*
   + Model results
   + **Maps!**
   
--

* *Figures should stand alone*

   + Use informative titles and labels

* Visualization is hard!

   + Take courses on visualization, e.g.:

## Put tables in plots!

Figure 3. Model Estimates of Disparities in Exposure to Gun Violence to Age 40

Hazard ratios (HR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) greater than 1 indicate higher estimated exposure to gun violence. HRs were estimated with a semi-parametric Turnbull proportional hazards model. IRRs were estimated with a negative binomial regression. Models are weighted to permit generalizing estimates of exposure to the population of children coming of age in Chicago in the 1990s. Case weights applied during estimation are constructed from a combination of original survey design weights and weights for attrition constructed using predictions from binary logistic regression models. The final weights used in the analysis are the product of the survey design weights and attrition weights at each wave. Observations receive the combined weight at their final follow-up period (e.g., an individual observed through wave 3 would receive a weight equal to the product of the survey design weight, their wave 2 attrition weight, and their wave 3 attrition weight). Results are insensitive to trimming weights to the center 90% of the distribution. Results are also similar as alternative specifications of survival models (see eFigure 2) and without weights (see eFigure 3). Sample sizes are 2,417 for seen shot, 2,135 for been shot, and 649 for nearby shootings.
